- Telegram.BotBuilder is a library that allows you to structure your commands, handlers and logic of your program.
- Based on [`Telegram.Bot.Framework`](https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot.Framework) but modified for the new version of [`Telegram.Bot`](https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot) [`18.0.0-alpha.3`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Telegram.Bot/18.0.0-alpha.3) 
- Based on dotnet standard 2.1

  >And of course I made this library for my own use because this approach is extremely convenient and useful when developing complex Telegram bots.
  >I am always open to your changes, commits and wishes :)
